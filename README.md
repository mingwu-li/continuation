## Numerical Continuation

This repo is created for documenting materials and references for numerical continuation.

### Lecture and tutorials
* *Tutorial of numerical continuation and bifurcation theory for systems and synthetic biology* This tutorial provides an introduction to nonlinear dynamics and numerical bifurcation. In particular, a review of widely used numerical continuation packages is given to help both new and experienced practitioners in choosing the appropriate software tools for their need. This tutorial can be found at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05226.pdf
* *Lecture Notes on Numerical Analysis of Nonlinear Equations* Lecture notes were written by Eusebius J Doedel. You can have a quick idea about the underlying math of this method by studying these lecture notes. The slides of the notes can be found at http://indy.cs.concordia.ca/auto/notes.pdf . A book chapter on the notes is available at https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6356-5_1
* *Methods of continuation and their implementation in the COCO software platform with application to delay differential equations* This paper treats comprehensively the construction of problems from nonlinear dynamics and constrained optimization amenable to parameter continuation techniques. It details a theoretical framework for a COCO-compatible toolbox able to support the analysis of a large family of problems related to delay.

### Books

* *Practical Bifurcation and Stability Analysis* This book combines a practical, hands-on approach with many examples and applications from science and engineering and a numerical approach, non-technical approach with only calculus required as background. You can find this book at https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-1740-9
